export const brandGuideLineText = `A brand isn’t static. Its performance changes over time as consumer preferences shift, new channels appear and competition piles into the market.

For instance, a brand’s rise might be unsustainably fad-driven; a decline might be due to a failure to recognize pockets of opportunity.
We help you position, develop and invest in your brands to differentiate and drive growth. And we do it by bringing an analytical perspective to brand strategy so clients can realize maximum value across all brands, products and channels — both physical and online ­— while recognizing the brand’s emotional elements.`
